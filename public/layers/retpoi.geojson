The dog had been with Lewis on that side trip, and no geographical feature had yet been named for him during the entire expedition. I consulted microcopies of the journals held by the American Philosophical Society, half suspecting I would find that Seaman’s Creek was actually Scannon’s Creek.

The expedition had paused to hunt, with Lewis and Pierre Cruzatte setting off alone. Separated by a strand of willow trees, Cruzatte mistook Lewis, dressed in brown leather, for an elk and shot him in the right thigh and buttocks. Lewis immediately suspected that Cruzatte, who had notably poor eyesight, had accidentally fired upon him. When he called Cruzatte's name and received no response, Lewis grew concerned that the group was under attack by Indians. He hurried back to the canoes and alerted the rest of the expedition to arm themselves and find Cruzatte. The men returned quickly, having seen no Indians but discovered Cruzatte in the undergrowth. While Lewis and Gass dressed Lewis's wound, Cruzatte claimed not to have heard Lewis's cries. Lewis recorded in his journals that although he did not believe Cruzatte to have intentionally fired, he suspected that Cruzatte had hidden upon realizing that he had maimed an expedition leader, frightened of the consequences he might face.

While Lewis and Clark had continued their westward journey, the Mandan had been locked in conflict with other local tribes, including the Sioux. The Mandan were glad to see the expedition again, and send them gifts of corn, beans, and squash. Lewis and Clark parted ways with Sacagawea and Charbonneau—fittingly, the site of their first meeting. Clark later regretted not remunerating Sacagawea for her work; without her diplomatic, translation, and navigational skills, the expedition's success would have been jeopardized. That Sacagawea assisted the Corps of Discovery so extensively was a significant accomplishment. At the age of sixteen, she crossed the country with an infant on her back and provided the expedition with crucial support. Her establishment of contacts with indigenous peoples and contributions to the expedition's natural history remain salient aspects of American history.
