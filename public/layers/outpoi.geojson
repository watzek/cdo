The meeting occurred at the site of Council Bluffs. The Oto, part of the Southern Sioux tribes, resided along the Missouri River. Their livelihood was based mostly on hunting buffalo but they also farmed. Their huts were oven-shaped, earth-covered houses grouped into towns. Upon meeting them, Lewis remarked \"Those two parts of nations, Ottos and Missouries[sic], now residing together is about 250 men\". However, due to smallpox, this number represented only a fraction of what the population had once been. The diseases that had wiped out many Native Americans had severely depleted their numbers. The meeting at Council Bluffs involved several chief members of the tribes and the entire Lewis & Clark Expedition. During the council, the Native Americans were told they were the \"children\" of a new \"great father\" who would provide them with trade and protection in place of their unreliable commerce with the French and the Spanish. It was a speech Lewis would deliver to numerous tribes throughout the journey. As Roy Appleman wrote in his article \"Lewis and Clark: The Route 160 Years Later,\" the meeting between the Oto and the Corps \"was the first of many meetings with Western Indians\" over the course of the expedition.", "Synopsis level": "complex synopsis", "Journal Entries": "https:\/\/lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu\/item\/lc.jrn.1804-08-03#lc.jrn.1804-08-03.01", "Secondary Source": "Gale, Kira.
